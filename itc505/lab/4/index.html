            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p class="abstract">
                Health concerns brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with technological advancements over the
                past two
                decades have altered the traditional workplace setting. Some professionals in the tertiary and
                quaternary economic sectors
                have grown accustomed to virtual working environments, whereas others, including essential workers, have
                experienced less
                flexibility in this regard and continue to commute to physical work settings. During the pandemic,
                residents of underresourced
                communities, who were more likely to adopt lower-cost shared-use travel modes and would have benefited
                from
                good access to high-quality bicycling infrastructure, embodied a greater share of the nonhealthcare
                workforce who was
                required to commute to a physical work setting. This circumstance highlighted a need for research that
                examines bicycling
                accessibility to workplaces distinguished by telework potential, with a hypothesis that underresourced
                communities with
                more limited mobility options have poorer bicycling access to traditional workplace settings. In
                response, this study, which
                describes the application of a novel bicyclist routing algorithm, investigated how these differences in
                job accessibility relate to
                variations in the social context of neighborhoods where bicyclist commute trips originate, and the level
                of traffic stress
                incurred by a current or prospective bicyclist along modeled routes in Flagstaff, AZ. Study findings,
                which in part confirmed
                its hypothesis while also noting a latent demand for bicycling to physical workplaces along low-stress
                facilities, offer unique
                insights into how the changing nature of work should be accounted for as active transportation planners
                and policy makers
                seek to provide safer and more robust bicycle networks to their diverse communities.

                        Continued advancements in information and communication
                        technologies and the immediate impacts of Covid-
                        19 pandemic travel restrictions starting in March 2020
                        resulted in the sudden and dramatic increase of teleworking.
                        Telework, or the ability for an employee to forego
                        their commute to perform work-related duties remotely
                        (1), has risen in prominence over the last two decades (2)
                        to become a commonly employed practice by many professionals
                        in the tertiary (service-based) and quaternary
                        (knowledge-based) sectors of the economy. Accordingly,
                        employees in professions related to communication,
                        financial services, and information technology were wellsituated
                        and perhaps better capable of transitioning to a
                        home-based work environment at the pandemic’s onset than employees in other sectors (e.g.,
                        manufacturing) or
                        those deemed to be essential occupations. Essential workers,
                        who continued to commute to physical establishments
                        during the height of the pandemic, represent a
                        range of employees from different industries, with individuals from underresourced communities
                        representing
                        a significant share of nonhealthcare workers required
                        to commute to a physical setting during the pandemic
                        (3). Having to commute to a physical establishment for
                        work demands reliable mobility options, with personal
                        vehicle ownership more likely to place a financial burden
                        on low-income households and residents of underresourced
                        communities (4).

                        options such as public transit, which remained available
                        as a lower-cost travel option, were positively associated
                        with disease transmission (5).</p>

                        In more common times, as well as the extraordinary
                        circumstances brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic,
                        bicycling has the potential to offer an inexpensive and
                        more sustainable commute mode than the automobile.
                        However, many American cities have incomplete bike
                        networks that require bicyclists to traverse commute
                        routes with long stretches of high-stress facilities.
                        Furthermore, many individuals who would be interested
                        in bicycling because of its economic, health, and environmental
                        benefits if a safe and connected network existed
                        are likely to continue to forego bicycling for personal
                        safety reasons. As such, alleviating network barriers
                        faced by current bicyclists and individuals, who for
                        safety reasons have not considered bicycling as a feasible
                        option when commuting to their physical workplace, is a
                        growing area of pursuit for local planning agencies.
                        Merging a need for innovative planning tools capable of
                        identifying the latent demand for bicyclists if given safer
                        bicycling facilities and understanding the changing
                        nature of work, this research sought to implement a
                        modern bicyclist network routing platform to investigate
                        the role of neighborhood context and bicycling route
                        comfort in accessibility to physical (and virtual) workplaces
                        by bicyclists with varying levels of traffic risk
                        aversion. A study hypothesis was that neighborhoods
                        with a higher representation of low-income and racial or
                        ethnic minority residents, who reflect a large share of
                        nonhealthcare essential workers, required to commute
                        during the pandemic, are more likely to have poorer
                        access to physical work environments when commuting
                        via bicycle.
                        In addressing this research aim, the structure of this
                        study of bicycling accessibility in Flagstaff, AZ is as follows.
                        First, a review of prior bicycling accessibility studies
                        is offered, with a later focus on those with a social equity–
                        based lens. This review is followed by a description of
                        data and methods used to classify bike network stress and
                        bicyclist route choices as well as a delineation of physical
                        and virtual jobs and analysis of job destination accessibility.
                        A third section discusses the descriptive and modeling
                        results of this study’s application of a bicyclist network
                        routing platform to understand neighborhood differences
                        in bicycling accessibility, which is followed by a concluding
                        section that describes this study’s contributions.

                        Although the study of bicycling access to destinations
                        has been relatively limited in planning practice (6), recent
                        contributions have established a knowledge base underscoring
                        its value to active transportation study, progress
                        in measurement, and development as a new planning
                        tool to help address transport inequities. Only in the past
                        decade have accessibility studies of bicycling risen to
                        greater prominence (7), with initial studies in this
                        research area centered on the idea of bikeability or suitability
                        for bicycling within a given geographic boundary.
                        In an early suitability study of commuting by bicycle in
                        Arizona, Sisson et al. created quarter-mile buffers
                        around 14 elementary school locations and scored the
                        bikeability of their enclosed street links based on traffic
                        conditions and roadway design characteristics; they
                        found that most school locations were adequate for

                        school-aged children to bicycle (8). In a study of bikeability
                        in Vancouver, Canada, Winters et al. developed a
                        bicycling planning tool that generated an index based on
                        bike facility availability, topography, connectivity, and
                        local destinations to visualize areas of low and high suitability
                        for bicycling across the city (9). McNeil similarly
                        sought to operationalize the bikeability of particular
                        neighborhoods in Portland, OR via an objective assessment
                        of weighted destination types (e.g., schools, stores,
                        parks) found within various sizes of catchment areas
                        extending from 26 locations across the city (10). The
                        results of this study found that centrally located neighborhoods
                        characterized by higher household incomes
                        had better bikeability than neighborhoods with lowerincome
                        households and more suburban street networks.
                        Further progressing this field of research, several bicycling
                        accessibility studies have demonstrated the added
                        benefit of classifying the underlying bike network and
                        potential bicycling route alternatives based on traffic
                        safety and security. Incorporating perceived bicycling
                        comfort, Lowry et al. introduced a method for calculating
                        bikeability that used an existing accessibility measure
                        and approach for classifying any facility that permits
                        bicycling with an objectively defined bicycle level of
                        stress (11). The application of this planning assessment
                        tool in Moscow, ID, was done to evaluate a set of capital
                        investment scenarios for improving bikeability within the
                        city. Imani et al. (12) applied a four-tiered level of traffic
                        stress (LTS) measure (13) to a street network in
                        Toronto, Canada, while adopting a cumulative opportunities
                        accessibility metric to estimate bicycling access
                        within a 30-min commute based on LTS thresholds.
                        Neighborhood cycling access to jobs was bifurcated at
                        5,000 jobs to distinguish between low and high access
                        levels, which informed the specification of a binary logit
                        model to identify associated predictors. In a northern
                        Delaware study, Furth et al. advanced their four-tiered
                        LTS measure to account for annual average daily traffic
                        and other road design configurations to similarly examine
                        job accessibility by bicycling only on low-stress facilities
                        (14). Owen and Murphy estimated accessibility to
                        jobs by bicycling for the 50 largest metropolitan regions
                        in the United States with a similar four-tiered LTS measure
                        applied to street networks and travel time calculations
                        using OpenTripPlanner software (15).

                        Other notable studies have also evaluated bicycling
                        accessibility by assessing network connectivity with isochrones
                        generated by employing routing processes. In
                        an early nonmotorized accessibility study, Iacono et al.
                        put forth a set of practical strategies for addressing
                        issues with measuring walking and bicycling accessibility
                        related to zonal structure and travel networks in calculating
                        access to shopping destinations via the
                        shortest network path between two census geographies
                        (16). Cabral et al. evaluated low-stress bicycling connectivity
                        improvements in Edmonton, Canada spurred
                        by the addition of 20 km of protected bicycle lanes via
                        the application of a shortest path algorithm with a
                        detour factor used to remain exclusively on a low-stress
                        network (17). Gehrke et al., in turn, measured improvements
                        in bicycling access to employment opportunities
                        related to the proposed introduction of a shared-use
                        pathway in Cambridge, MA, that applied the Cyclist

                        Conceptual advancements in bicycling accessibility
                        measurement have also been accompanied by socialequity-
                        focused studies, conducted to help identify communities
                        who are likeliest to benefit from bike facility
                        improvements and disparately affected by existing bike
                        network conditions. In the context of this study, understanding
                        how past bicycling accessibility research has
                        analyzed impacts to underresourced communities could
                        offer some insights into the associations between nonhealthcare
                        essential workers and bicycling access to
                        physical workplaces. Houde et al. (19) used six nonconsecutive
                        years of bicycling infrastructure snapshots in
                        Montreal, Canada to determine whether citywide expansions
                        in bike network connectivity improved bicycling
                        accessibility for low-income populations, immigrants,
                        older residents, and children. Study results revealed that
                        although low-income individuals generally had good
                        bicycling access throughout the 25-year period, a strong
                        decrease in access was observed for immigrants and
                        seniors, with little improvement for districts with higher
                        shares of children (19). In a study of bicyclist access to
                        employment or educational opportunities in Bogota,
                        Columbia, Rosas-Satiza´ bal created a potential accessibility
                        metric with a distance decay factor and inequality
                        indicators to identify social inequities between bicyclist
                        groups, finding that one-half of Bogota’s bicyclists have
                        access to less than 10% of all employment and educational
                        opportunities owing to the city’s urban structure
                        and longer travel distances for lower-income residents to
                        downtown job sites (20). In another South American
                        study of bicyclist accessibility, Mora et al. examined
                        whether the expansion of a bicycling network in
                        Santiago, Chile over 15 years had disparate impacts for
                        communities characterized by residents of different
                        income cohorts, concluding that most high-quality bicycling
                        facilities are located in central communities
                        characterized by residents earning higher incomes (21).
                        Incorporating LTS classifications of road networks into
                        a study of bicycling access in Rio de Janeiro and
                        Curitiba, Brazil, Tucker and Manaugh similarly found
                        that each city had substantially more bicycle infrastructure
                        in wealthier areas and, subsequently, these residents
                        have higher job accessibility along safer routes (22). In a
                        Minneapolis, MN, study of socioeconomic discrepancies
                        in job accessibility via low-stress bicycling facilities and
                        links in the overall street network, Wang and Lindsey
                        compared Gini coefficients to assess the potential social
                        inequities faced by disadvantaged populations, finding
                        that low-stress, multiuse urban trails were less likely to
                        be distributed in census block groups with higher racial
                        or ethnic minority populations and more families living
                        in poverty (23). Kent and Karner, in a Baltimore, MD,
                        bicycling accessibility study, introduced a set of performance
                        measures to compare the potential accessibility
                        benefits and socioeconomic impacts of infrastructure
                        projects, highlighting options from their analysis with
                        the potential to better serve disadvantaged neighborhoods
                        experiencing racial segregation, higher levels of
                        poverty, and lower vehicle ownership rates (24).

                        Taken together, this review has highlighted some of
                        the conceptual and empirical advancements of recent
                        research investigating location-based bicycling accessibility.
                        Specifically, greater focus has been placed on implementing
                        accessibility metrics that account for the
                        perceived quality of the network for bicycling and quantifying
                        the impact of current or proposed bicycle facilities
                        on destination accessibility of underresourced communities.
                        This research aims to meet this practice standard
                        for examining bicycling accessibility while also contributing
                        to a growing evidence base assessing the social equity

                        whether underresourced communities have poorer bicycling
                        access to traditional workplace settings. To this
                        end, this study’s application of an original bicyclist network
                        routing platform to identify differences in bicycling

                        to varying neighborhood-level socioeconomic attributes
                        seeks to offer a technical advancement that can be
                        adopted by transportation planners to prioritize facility
                        investments that address existing transport inequities.

                    <p>To understand the perceived comfort of the street network
                        for bicycling, an updated version of the four-tiered
                        LTS classification scheme (14) initially described by
                        Mekuria et al. (25) was adopted for this study. The
                        updated version of the LTS scheme classifies segments
                        based on traffic characteristics (e.g., travel lanes, posted
                        travel speeds) and the presence of dedicated bike infrastructure.
                        For this study, a modified version of this updated LTS scheme was applied to Flagstaff, AZ using
                        the OpenStreetMap (OSM) transportation network
                        (Table 1). The use of this open-source and editable transportation
                        network for LTS classification enhances the
                        transferability of the network output but requires some
                        aggregation of categories because of data availability
                        limitations with regard to bike lane widths and daily traffic
                        volumes. Where posted travel speed (‘‘maxspeed’’ tag)
                        gaps existed in the crowd-sourced OSM data set, an
                        imputed value based on the OSM ‘‘highway’’ tag designation
                        and prevailing traffic speed limits in Arizona was
                        inserted: residential=25 mph, service=35 mph, secondary=

                        ‘‘interested but concerned’’ bicyclist, and those facilities

                        ‘‘enthused and confident’’ or ‘‘strong and fearless’’ bicyclist

                        service, as its base network routing engine, with modifications
                        that permit the creation of distinct bicyclist
                        profiles with route and travel speed differences that are
                        sensitive to link-level changes in network facilities and
                        topography. GraphHopper’s base network routingalgorithm
                        generates an internal representation of the
                        street network as a graph of directed links (or edges)
                        between two nodes. In this study, OSM network data
                        for Flagstaff were extracted using Geofabrik tools to
                        identify links, while nodes were represented as U.S.
                        census block centroids in the study area. For all origin–
                        destination pairs, after assigning impedance values to
                        the graph’s edges based on road segment length as well
                        as the speed of a bicyclist type and their aversion to the
                        road segment, the GraphHopper routing-algorithm
                        determines the route between the two trip ends with the
                        lowest summation of impendence values. In this study,
                        only routes generated for an ‘‘interested but concerned’’
                        bicyclist who travels at a slower speed than the
                        ‘‘enthused and confident’’ bicyclist profile, and has
                        greater sensitivity to changes in elevation over a road
                        segment’s length, were analyzed. Greater detail on the
                        assignment of travel speeds based on road class and
                        bicyclist type and aversion factors based on road class
                        and available bicycle facilities is provided in the
                        research by Gehrke et al. (18). Having refined and transferred the CRANC tool to
                        this study’s setting, the next step was to measure the
                        bicycling accessibility of the ‘‘interested but concerned’’
                        to a set of destinations. Using the GraphHopper isochrone
                        module, the travel time for the interested but concerned
                        bicyclist was computed from every U.S. census block centroid contained in the city’s boundary
                        (trip origin)
                        to all centroids in Coconino County, including the
                        city of Flagstaff (trip destinations). Figure 2 offers an
                        illustration of the result of this process for an exemplar
                        trip origin. The attributes associated with any destination
                        centroid within the 30-min isochrone for a particular
                        trip origin were then related to the U.S. block where the
                        trip origin was located. For this study, 2,076 U.S. census
                        block centroids were found in Flagstaff and 20,267 centroids
                        inside Coconino County. Additionally, the percentage
                        of network facilities classified by different LTS
                        categories within an isochrone was attributed to the centroid
                        of the originating census block.

                        Identifying the U.S. census block geography as the unit
                        of analysis for measuring bicycling accessibility, the

                        (LEHD) data set’s workplace area characteristics file
                        was used to represent employment locations. Although
                        the 2019 workplace information has the benefit of signifying
                        employment characteristics before the onset of
                        the Covid-19 pandemic, its representation at a 2010
                        decennial census geography required augmentation for
                        these data to complement Flagstaff’s current boundary
                        and the most recent available information on neighborhood
                        socioeconomic context. As such, the 2010 U.S.
                        census blocks that intersected the city’s current boundary
                        were selected, with the centroids of the blocks overlapping
                        the city’s boundary placed in the portion of the
                        block congruent with the current city boundary.
                        Using the revised distribution of census block centroids
                        in Flagstaff and blocks outside of the city but
                        within Coconino County, the next step was to determine
                        which types of jobs located in a block required the physical
                        presence of a worker (physical jobs) and those jobs
                        that could be performed remotely (virtual jobs). In this
                        study, the distribution of jobs that could be performed at
                        home, according to their two-digit North American
                        Industry Classification System (NAICS) code determined
                        by Dingel and Neiman, was applied to each census block
                        geography. The collection of block-level physical and virtual job
                        totals, determined by applying the virtual job shares.noted in Table 2, was used to estimate the
                        number of
                        jobs that could be accessed by an ‘‘interested but concerned’’
                        bicyclist in 30 min. To help characterize the
                        social context of the block-level trip origins, a set of individual-
                        and household-level measures were constructed
                        from 5-year estimates of the 2016 to 2020 American
                        Community Survey. Table 3 summarizes these selected
                        measures, which include the gender, age, and race or ethnicity
                        distribution of study area residents as well as the
                        distribution of annual incomes, housing tenure, and vehicle
                        ownership rates of study area households.

                        This section is divided into two subsections. The first
                        subsection describes the spatial distribution of virtual
                        and physical workplaces in the study area, followed by a
                        description of the variation in bicycling access to these
                        two destination types across trip origins. The second subsection
                        describes the modeling results of estimating bicycling
                        access to physical and virtual jobs as a function of
                        origin-related contextual factors.

                        <i>Physical and Virtual Job Distribution and Bicycling
                            Accessibility</i>

                        Figure 3 is a side-by-side visualization of the distribution
                        of physical and virtual jobs in the city of Flagstaff. A
                        review of census blocks grouped in the highest physical
                        job category and clusters of blocks with higher concentrations
                        of physical jobs revealed land use patterns that
                        were specific to the study area, and common locations
                        for prospective bike commutes. Physical job locations
                        were predominately scattered east-to-west, adjacent to
                        U.S. Route 66 and the railroad tracks that bisect the
                        northern and southern halves of the city (Figure 3a). The
                        proximity of these two facilities and Interstate-40, which
                        also runs east-to-west on the eastern half of the city, has
                        a likely association with the stretch of manufacturing and warehousing job locations within the
                        central-eastern portion
                        of the city. The Flagstaff Mall and its high share of
                        retail job positions can be seen in the northeast, whereas
                        other large physical job concentrations pertaining to
                        commercial highway stores are noticeable to the east of
                        the city’s centrally located downtown. The centralwestern
                        portion of the city, which includes a cluster of
                        smaller retail shops and larger big box stores, has a cluster
                        of blocks with 50 to 500 physical jobs, whereas
                        smaller census blocks with more than 500 physical jobs,
                        which include Northern Arizona University (NAU) and
                        Coconino Community College, are located south of the
                        city’s downtown.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In contrast, census blocks with higher counts of virtual
                        jobs were fewer in number and generally located in
                        more confined clusters along the aforementioned transportation
                        facilities in the city’s eastern half (Figure 3b).
                        Although many of the same census blocks with high virtual
                        job totals mirrored those areas with more physical
                        jobs, a handful of smaller blocks in the city’s downtown
                        and western half had blocks with virtual job totals that
                        were classified in a higher category (i.e., 500 and above
                        versus 101 to 500). These identified blocks tended to be
                        the location of administrative offices for local or state
                        governments or smaller financial firms. In all, although
                        there were notable discrepancies in the distribution of
                        census blocks based on the location of physical and virtual
                        jobs, most areas with a higher intensity of physical
                        jobs were also the location of virtual jobs, albeit with a
                        slightly lower total of the latter job type. This descriptive finding is probably related to a
                        lack of diversity in the
                        job sectors found in Flagstaff and the circumstance that
                        the city is home to some larger companies that have a
                        strong manufacturing, retail, or warehousing presence
                        and a smaller percentage of jobs associated with information,
                        finance and insurance, or management. With an understanding of the distribution of physical
                        employment locations and the share of positions at current
                        workplaces that could be performed virtually,
                        Figure 4 provides a visualization of the number of physical
                        and virtual jobs that could be reached within a 30-
                        min commute by an ‘‘interested but concerned’’ bicyclist.
                        Given the higher number of physical jobs located in
                        Flagstaff, it is unsurprising to see from this second sideby-
                        side comparison

                        that bicyclists from the majority of
                        residences could reach over 10,000 potential jobs within
                        the designated travel time. Potential ‘‘interested but concerned’’
                        bicyclists who reside in the western half of the
                        city had stronger bicycling access to physical jobs,
                        whereas improvements could also be found in neighborhoods
                        to the south and southeast of the city’s downtown.
                        In all, physical and virtual job access appeared to be
                        greatest for residents in centrally located neighborhoods
                        north of Interstate-40, with no clear distinction of census
                        block clusters where residents would have less accessibility
                        to physical jobs. To better identify any measurable differences between
                        physical and virtual job accessibility for ‘‘interested but
                        concerned’’ bicyclists, Figure 5 visualizes block-level differences
                        in job access, in which darker shades of orange reflect larger physical job access disparities
                        and darker
                        shades of blue reflect greater discrepancies in virtual job
                        accessibility by bicycle. From this map, several census
                        blocks where residences were found to have greater bicycling
                        accessibility to virtual jobs can be found in the city’s
                        eastern half. Although the number of blocks meeting this
                        condition was limited, their location in the sparsely
                        populated neighborhoods away from the city’s larger
                        economic hubs is unsurprising. In turn, the cluster of
                        census blocks with the highest number of physical jobs
                        that can be accessed in a 30-min bicycling commute in
                        comparison to virtual jobs was located at the northwest
                        corner of where Interstate-40 intersects Interstate-17.
                        This area has few residences, is the site of a Walmart as
                        well as a several restaurants and hotels, and benefits from
                        low-stress access through Northern Arizona University
                        to manufacturing and warehousing sites located in the
                        central-eastern part of the city. Whereas those areas with
                        the largest discrepancy between physical and virtual job
                        access were found in the northern half of Flagstaff,
                        blocks immediately to the southeast and southwest of the
                        aforementioned interstate junction were also found to
                        have disproportionate bicycling access to physical job
                        locations. These two areas are largely residential areas
                        with single-family houses and an underlying suburban
                        street network.

                    <b>Conclusions</b>

                    <p>
                        This study of bicycling accessibility to physical and virtual
                        job locations sought to contribute to an expanding
                        field of bicycling research. First, this study described the
                        refinement of a previously developed bicyclist routing
                        platform (18) and its application in a new study area.
                        This adaptation of the CRANC tool to use OSM as an
                        underlying network and to quantify the potential stress
                        encountered by a bicyclist based on a four-tier LTS classification
                        scheme has improved the potential transferability
                        of this open-source planning tool and offered greater
                        nuance in routing an ‘‘interested but concerned’’ bicyclist
                        who may not view a network as a simple dichotomy of
                        low- and high-stress links. This application of the
                        CRANC tool to Flagstaff, AZ, which is characterized by
                        an extensive off-street trail network and topographic variation,
                        also required routing algorithm improvements
                        related to sensitivity in link-level elevation changes and
                        surface conditions.
                    <p>
                        Second, this study sought to offer insights in relation
                        to bicycling accessibility to physical and virtual job locations,
                        with a clearer identification of the former job

                        type
                        needed to further parse out where additions or improvements
                        to bicycling facilities can be made to help promote
                        utilitarian travel by this more sustainable and healthy
                        mode. Recent global circumstances coupled with ongoing
                        technological advancements have brought to light the
                        ability for some jobs to be performed remotely or at
                        home and the necessity for others to have a worker’s
                        physical presence. During the Covid-19 pandemic, these
                        physical jobs were generally held by essential workers,
                        who were more likely to travel during the height of the
                        pandemic and be more susceptible to disease transmission
                        when using public transit (3). Given that many
                        essential workers are also more likely to earn a low wage
                        (33), prioritization for the provision of high-quality bicycling
                        facilities near employment districts with a higher concentration of physical jobs should be
                        considered as a
                        further means of providing a safe, healthy, and low-cost
                        travel option to urban residents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, the findings from this study’s analysis of cumulative
                        accessibility to physical job locations hinted at the
                        potential latent demand for bicycle commuting for residents
                        who may traditionally be less likely to adopt this
                        travel mode. Census block origins with a higher percentage
                        of older working-age adults, individuals who identify
                        as Hispanic or Latino, and households with lower
                        annual incomes were all more likely to have better bicycling
                        access to physical job locations when considering
                        lower-stress routes and slower travel speeds. However,
                        many of these communities have been previously found
                        to constitute a relatively low share of bicyclists who currently
                        commute in the United States. Accordingly, these
                        findings support a growing need for continued analyses
                        that could help to better inform transportation planners
                        and policy makers about how to market bicycling as a
                        potentially feasible, safe, and cost-effective travel alternative
                        to commuting by car, and to ensure that facility
                        improvements for small, critical gaps to a safe network
                        are prioritized to offer continuity in low-stress bicycling
                        conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Also of importance, the application of this introduced
                        bicycle routing engine to investigate whether underresourced
                        communities have poorer bicycling access to traditional
                        workplace settings revealed interesting insights.
                        Whereas neighborhoods with a higher share of individuals
                        who identified as Hispanic or Latino were found to
                        have greater bicycling access to physical jobs, neighborhoods
                        with a higher share of individuals who reported
                        an annual household income below $10,000 were found
                        to have lower levels of accessibility. Moreover, neighborhoods
                        with a greater share of both Hispanic or Latino
                        residents and lower-income households were found to
                        have poorer bicycling access to physical job opportunities.
                        This study finding points to the continued importance
                        of examining the intersection of socioeconomic
                        identities in transportation planning and the potential
                        benefit that CRANC and other similar decision-making
                        tools may have in helping to recognize communities
                        where bike facility improvements should be prioritized to
                        improve access.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Although this study has offered the aforementioned
                        contributions, future research should address some of its
                        more prominent limitations. Although notable advancements
                        to the CRANC tool were made for its application
                        in a small urban setting, greater variation in travel times
                        and employment opportunities are likely to be found in
                        more populous cities. As such, future studies adopting
                        this bicycling planning tool should look to assess larger
                        metropolitan regions with greater land use diversity and
                        more polycentric development patterns.

            <h2>Styles for .main Class</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>.main</code> class is used to style a container or section within the webpage for organizing
                content. It has the following styles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>background-color: rgb(230, 235, 237);</code> - This sets the background color of the container
                    to a light gray.</li>
                <li><code>border: 1px solid navy;</code> - It adds a 1-pixel solid navy border around the container.
                </li>
                <li><code>text-align: justify;</code> - This aligns the text content within the container using full
                    justification.</li>
                <li><code>padding: 10px 10px;</code> - It provides 10 pixels of padding on all sides of the container,
                    ensuring content is spaced appropriately.
            </ul>

            <h2>Styles for .container, .left-half, .right-half, and .abstract Classes</h2>
            <p>
                These classes are used to structure the layout of the webpage. The <code>.container</code> class applies
                grid-based layout, while the <code>.left-half</code>, <code>.right-half</code>, and
                <code>.abstract</code> classes define styling for different sections. These styles include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>display: grid;</code> - It creates a grid layout for the page content.</li>
                <li><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;</code> - The grid has two equally sized columns.</li>
                <li><code>height: 100%;</code> - The container's height is set to 100% of the viewport height.</li>
                <li><code>border: 0px;</code> - These classes remove borders.</li>
                <li><code>padding-right: 20px;</code> - Adds 20 pixels of right padding to elements, creating space.
            </ul>

            <h2>Font Choices</h2>
            <p>
                The chosen font family for the entire document is <code>Arial, sans-serif</code>.

                <li><code>h2 { font-size: 24px; }</code> - Sets the font size for secondary headings.</li>
                <li><code>p { font-size: 16px; }</code> - Defines the font size for paragraphs.
            </ul>

            <h2>Color Choices</h2>

            <h2>Margin and Padding Choices</h2>
            <p>
                These styles control spacing for the document:

                    container.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><code>.hr { border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; }</code> - Creates a thematic break to
                    separate content sections visually.
